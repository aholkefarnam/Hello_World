# Hello_World

Hi there!

My name is Anna Holke-Farnam, but I typically go by my middle name, Josie. I am a full-time undergraduate student at the University of Iowa, pursuing a B.B.A, in Business Analytics and Information Systems with a minor in Political Science (expected May 2023). I have a wide variety of interests, including technology, math, reading, and dance! I am currently seeking an internship for an opportunity to learn more about how my techncial skills that I have began developing will apply to the business world.
